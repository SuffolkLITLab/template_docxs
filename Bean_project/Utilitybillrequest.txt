<p>This is a class project under active development. You should not rely on it as a source of legal information. It is incomplete.</p>
<p>Use this letter if your apartment has a single utility meter that is shared with multiple units or the common areas and your landlord splits the full utility bill among all residents. Your landlord is required to provide you with copies of the actual utility bills for the entire property so that you can be certain the landlord is apportioning the bills correctly. The letter you can fill out gives your landlord a certain number of days to respond. Allow your landlord that amount of time to reply to your request.</p>

<br><br>
*Please note that you should PROOFREAD your letter before you send it to make sure that it makes sense and that it is complete and accurate.

How would you like to proceed?

<x>lname</x>

<x>laddress</x>


I, <x>tname1</x>, reside at your property located at <x>tstreet</x> <x>taddress</x>.


As you know, I reside in a “single metered residential building” because my <x>utility</x> bill(s) is/are based on a meter that measures my unit plus other units or common areas. I am writing to inform you that Minnesota Statute § 504B.215 Subdivision 2a. (3) requires landlords at such a building to provide past copies of actual utility bills to tenants.

Pursuant to this statute and the terms of our lease agreement, I am requesting copies of the actual utility bills for the address listed above, in addition to each apportioned utility bill during the periods of my tenancy during which I received an apportioned utility bill. Please also send utility bills for the preceding two years or the time since you acquired the building if less than two years. 

Please send me the copies within 14 days.
