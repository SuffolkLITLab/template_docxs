Allow your landlord that amount of time to reply to your request.</p>

A[javascript:submit2('https://colarusso.pythonanywhere.com/2docx/','POST','','','','json_doc')]: Download Word file.

A: Email Word file to myself. 
	Q(sendto): What is your email address? Note: if you direct this email to an address other than your own, you will have no record that it was sent, and the purpose of the email will not be clear to someone who is not expecting it. If you want to send this file to someone, it is best to email it to yourself and then forward it on. 
	X:[javascript:submit2('https://colarusso.pythonanywhere.com/2email/','POST','','','','json_doc','_blank')]
		Q(9.2.1): Wait a moment. You should get a message telling you how things went. GOTO:didthatwork

	DOC(9.3):
<x>lname</x>								
<x>lstreet</x>
<x>laddress</x>

I, <x>tname1</x>, reside at your property located at <x>tstreet</x>, <x>taddress</x>.

I wish to inform you that Minnesota Statute §504B.161 requires that every landlord of residential premises, whether the lease is in writing or oral, do the following:

(1)	keep the premises and all common areas fit for the use intended by the parties;
(2)	keep the premises in reasonable repair during the term of the lease or license;
(3)	maintain the premises in compliance with the applicable health and safety laws of the state. 

Since parties to a lease or license of residential premises may not waive or modify the “covenants of habitability” imposed by this statute, the landlord must do these things regardless of any contrary lease terms (unless the tenant caused the disrepair by his or her willful, malicious, or irresponsible conduct).

I am requesting repairs within 14 days to the following items or conditions:

1.<x>itemone</x>
2.<x>nothaone</x>

	Q(llemail): What is your landlord's email address?

			Q(9.3.1.1): Wait a moment to see if a draft email opens. GOTO:didthatwork

		Q(9.3.2): Do you still want to open a draft email?
		A: Yes
			Q(9.3.2.1):GOTO:draft
