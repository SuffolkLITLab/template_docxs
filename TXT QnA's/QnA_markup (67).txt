<p>HOME Line is here to help you! HOME Line is a nonprofit Minnesota tenant advocacy organization that you can call at <a href="tel:612-728-5767">612-728-5767</a> or <a href="tel:866-866-3546">866-866-3546</a> for FREE legal help. </p>
<p>You can also answer the following questions to draft a form letter responding to a bill you received for bed bug extermination. You could download <a href="">a blank form letter</a> and fill it out yourself as well!.</p>


Q(terms): Do you agree to the <a href="" target="_blank">Letter Bot Terms of Service</a>?
A: Yes
	Q(1.1):GOTO:invoicebedbugs
A: No
	Q(1.2):GOTO:canthelp


Q(invoicebedbugs):Did you intentionally bring bedbugs into the property? 
A:No
	Q(2.1):GOTO:nointention
A:Yes
	Q(2.2):You should seek legal counsel. You can call our hotline or go online to our website to email an attorney. GOTO:anythingelse
Q(nointention):Did you go somewhere you knew had bedbugs? <p> Did you bring in furniture from the side of the road? <p> Did you do anything else or otherwise behave in a way which could be considered irresponsible? 
A:No
	Q(3.1):GOTO:notresponsible
A:Yes
	Q(3.2):You should seek legal counsel. You can call our hotline or go online to our website to email an attorney. GOTO:anythingelse
Q(notresponsible): In nearly all cases, Minnesota state law requires your landlord to maintain and repair the property. <p> Your landlord is also responsible for paying for these repairs even if the lease says otherwise. <p> Note that this is true even if the problem is something like bedbugs.   Sometimes landlords say that a tenant has to pay for a bedbug extermination because the bedbugs started in your unit. However, this is NOT true. <p> It is not good enough to say that the bedbugs hitched a ride in on you. The landlord must point to some specific act you took that was irresponsible if they want you to pay the bill. <p><p>   Would you like me to create a letter for you to send to your landlord responding to the bill for bedbug removal?
A:No
	Q(4.1):GOTO:repairend
A:Yes
	Q(4.2):GOTO:tname1

DOC(10):RESPONSE TO AN INVOICE FOR BED BUG REMOVAL
Q(how):There are three options: (1) download a pre-filled from letter (MS Word file) to edit and/or print; (2) email a copy of the same pre-filled from letter to yourself; or (3) Use my personal email on this device to send the content of that letter, but as the text of an email, to my landlord.
<br><br>
How would you like to proceed? 

A[javascript:submit2('https://colarusso.pythonanywhere.com/2docx/','POST','','','','json_doc')]: Download Word file.
	Q(10.1): Wait a moment to see if a download starts. GOTO:didthatwork
A: Email Word file to myself. 
	Q(sendto): What is your email address? Note: if you direct this email to an address other than your own, you will have no record that it was sent, and the purpose of the email will not be clear to someone who is not expecting it. If you want to send this file to someone, it is best to email it to yourself and then forward it on. 
	X:[javascript:submit2('https://colarusso.pythonanywhere.com/2email/','POST','','','','json_doc','_blank')]
		Q(10.2.1): Wait a moment. You should get a message telling you how things went. GOTO:didthatwork

<x>laddress</x>

I, <x>tname1</x> reside at your property located at <x>tstreet</x>, <x>taddress</x>.


This is a response to the invoice you sent me for bed bug treatment. I call your 
attention to Minnesota Statutes § 504B.161, subdivision 1, which makes the landlord responsible for maintenance unless the problem was caused by the “willful, malicious, or irresponsible conduct of the tenant.” I have not engaged in any such conduct regarding the bed bugs. Therefore, like any other maintenance problem — leaky toilet, flying bats in the attic, etc — the cost of dealing with the problem falls on you as landlord and not me as tenant. 

Since your invoice appears to violate Minnesota law I do not plan to pay it.  Please rescind the invoice within fourteen days. 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.
