<p>This is a class project under active development by Suffolk's <a href="http://suffolklitlab.org/" target="_blank">LIT Lab</a>. You should not rely on it as a source of legal information. It is incomplete.</p>
<p>HOME Line is here to help you! HOME Line is a nonprofit Minnesota tenant advocacy organization that you can call at <a href="tel:612-728-5767">612-728-5767</a> or <a href="tel:866-866-3546">866-866-3546</a> for FREE legal help. </p>
<p>You can also answer the following questions to draft a form letter requesting the return of your security deposit. You could download <a href="http://www.homelinemn.org/wp-content/uploads/Security-Deposit-Request-Form-Ltr_HOMLin_09-10.pdf" target="_blank">a blank form letter</a> and fill it out yourself as well!</p>
<p>If your landlord has not returned your deposit or did not give you a letter that explains how the deposit was used within 21 days after you moved out, use the form letter. If you need help calculating the interest on your deposit, use <a href="http://www.homelinemn.org/wp-content/uploads/security-deposit-interest1.pdf" target="_blank">this worksheet.</a></p>

Q(terms): Do you agree to the <a href="https://suffolklitlab.github.io/template_docxs/Letter_Bot_tos.html" target="_blank">Letter Bot Terms of Service</a>?
A: Yes
	Q(1.1):GOTO:secdep
A: No
	Q(1.2):GOTO:canthelp


Q(secdep):Have you received a letter explaining why you are not getting all or a portion of your deposit back?
A:No
	Q(2.1):GOTO:sorry
A:Yes
	Q(2.2):GOTO:receivedletter
Q(receivedletter):Did the landlord put the letter in the mail at least 21 days after your lease ended and you gave the landlord a mailing address?  <p> Putting it in the mail counts, so if the envelope is post-marked by the 21st, you should answer yes.
A:No
	Q(3.1):GOTO:noletter
A:Yes
	Q(3.2):GOTO:aftertwentyonedays
Q(noletter): Is your lease over and have you moved out?
A:No
	Q(4.1):Your least must be over and you must move out before the landlord has to return your deposit. However, if you have questions about what to do to ensure that you get your deposit, this is a good time to contact HOME Line. You can call our hotline (Number) or go online to our website to email an attorney.
A:Yes
	Q(4.2):GOTO:information
Q(information):Have you given your landlord an address to mail your security deposit to?
A:No
	Q(5.1):You must give your landlord a mailing address before your landlord has to return your deposit. It does not need to be where you live now. It can be a P.O. Box, or a friend's or family member's address. <p> You should provide a mailing address to your landlord. If you would like to seek legal counsel, you can call our hotline or go online to our website to email an attorney. GOTO:anythingelse
A:Yes
	Q(5.2):Your landlord has 21 days from the end of your lease and receipt of a mailing address (whichever happens last) to return your deposit. <p> If you would like to seek legal counsel, you can call our hotline or go online to our website to email an attorney. GOTO:anythingelse
Q(aftertwentyonedays):Once the tenancy is over and you have provided your former landlord with a mailing address, your former landlord has 21 days to either send you your deposit or a letter explaining the deductions from your deposit. <p> If your landlord misses this deadline, you can sue for double your deposit, double the interest on your deposit, plus an additional $500. 

<p>IMPORTANT LEGAL NOTICE: If you choose to write a letter below this letter proposes a settlement. Settlements are binding. If you do not understand the settlement proposed in the letter, DO NOT SEND THE LETTER. 
<p> If you would like to seek legal counsel, you can call our hotline or go online to our website to email an attorney. 
<p> If the landlord sent you a portion of the deposit back, you should seek legal advice before cashing the check. <p>

DOC(11):SECURITY DEPOSIT
Q(how):There are three options: (1) download a pre-filled from letter (MS Word file) to edit and/or print; (2) email a copy of the same pre-filled from letter to yourself; or (3) Use your personal email on this device to send the content of that letter, but as the text of an email, to my landlord.
<br><br>
Please remember to ALWAYS proofread your letters for accuracy.

How would you like to proceed? 

A[javascript:submit2('https://colarusso.pythonanywhere.com/2docx/','POST','','','','json_doc')]: Download Word file.
	Q(11.1): Wait a moment to see if a download starts. GOTO:didthatwork
A: Email Word file to myself. 
	Q(sendto): What is your email address? Note: if you direct this email to an address other than your own, you will have no record that it was sent, and the purpose of the email will not be clear to someone who is not expecting it. If you want to send this file to someone, it is best to email it to yourself and then forward it on. 
	X:[javascript:submit2('https://colarusso.pythonanywhere.com/2email/','POST','','','','json_doc','_blank')]
		Q(11.2.1): Wait a moment. You should get a message telling you how things went. GOTO:didthatwork
A: Email my landlord a plain-text email.

<x>lname</x>
<x>lstreet</x>
<x>laddress</x>

<x>tname1</x>
<x>tstreet</x>
<x>taddress</x>

I, <x>tname1</x>, vacated the premises located at <x>tstreet</x>, <x>taddress</x> on the <x>moveoutday</x> of <x>moveoutmonth</x>, <x>moveoutyear</x>.


Per Minnesota Statute ยง504B.178(3), you were required to return to me, within three weeks of my vacating the premises, one of the following:

My full deposit of $<x>securitydeposit</x> plus interest of $<x>interest</x> ; or 

A written statement showing the specific reasons for withholding my deposit or any portion of it, as well as the portion of my deposit not withheld, if any, plus interest.  

Since you have failed to fulfill these obligations, Minnesota Statute ยง504B.178(4) allows me to recover the portion of the deposit and interest illegally withheld, and, as a penalty, an amount equal to this amount, as well as court costs.  In addition, Minnesota Statute 
ยง504B.178(7) allows me to recover up to $500 for bad faith retention of my security deposit.  

I would, however, prefer to settle this issue out of court.  Therefore, please send me my full security deposit plus interest, as noted above, to the above address within five days.  If you fail to comply with my request, I will take court action to recover the full amount plus the penalties and punitive damages authorized by Minnesota Statutes.
