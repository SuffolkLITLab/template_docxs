<p>This is a class project under active development by Suffolk's <a href="http://suffolklitlab.org/" target="_blank">LIT Lab</a>. You should not rely on it as a source of legal information. It is incomplete.</p>
<p>HOME Line is here to help you! HOME Line is a nonprofit Minnesota tenant advocacy organization that you can call at <a href="tel:612-728-5767">612-728-5767</a> or <a href="tel:866-866-3546">866-866-3546</a> for FREE legal help. </p>
<p>You can also answer the following questions to draft a form letter to your landlord asking that they make repairs at your residence. You could download <a href="https://homelinemn.org/wp-content/uploads/demand-for-property.pdf">a blank form letter</a> and fill it out yourself as well!.</p>
<p>If your landlord needs to make repairs and you would like to request that they do, use this Letter Bot to help create a letter to send to your landlord.</p>

A[javascript:submit2('https://colarusso.pythonanywhere.com/2docx/','POST','','','','json_doc')]: Download Word file.
	Q(9.1): Wait a moment to see if a download starts. GOTO:didthatwork
A: Email Word file to myself. 
	Q(sendto): What is your email address? Note: if you direct this email to an address other than your own, you will have no record that it was sent, and the purpose of the email will not be clear to someone who is not expecting it. If you want to send this file to someone, it is best to email it to yourself and then forward it on. 
	X:[javascript:submit2('https://colarusso.pythonanywhere.com/2email/','POST','','','','json_doc','_blank')]
		Q(9.2.1): Wait a moment. You should get a message telling you how things went. GOTO:didthatwork

	DOC(9.3):
<x>lname</x>								
<x>lstreet</x>
<x>laddress</x>

I, <x>tname1</x>, reside at your property located at <x>tstreet</x>, <x>taddress</x>.

I wish to inform you that Minnesota Statute §504B.161 requires that every landlord of residential premises, whether the lease is in writing or oral, do the following:

(1)	keep the premises and all common areas fit for the use intended by the parties;
(2)	keep the premises in reasonable repair during the term of the lease or license;
(3)	maintain the premises in compliance with the applicable health and safety laws of the state. 

Since parties to a lease or license of residential premises may not waive or modify the “covenants of habitability” imposed by this statute, the landlord must do these things regardless of any contrary lease terms (unless the tenant caused the disrepair by his or her willful, malicious, or irresponsible conduct).

I am requesting repairs within 14 days to the following items or conditions:

1.<x>itemone</x>
2.<x>nothaone</x>

	Q(llemail): What is your landlord's email address?

			Q(9.3.1.1): Wait a moment to see if a draft email opens. GOTO:didthatwork
	A: I don't know?
		Q(9.3.2): Do you still want to open a draft email?
		A: Yes
			Q(9.3.2.1):GOTO:draft
		A: No
			Q(9.3.2.2): Okay, back to your options. GOTO:how

A: Yes
	Q(10.1): Great. GOTO:anythingelse
A: No
	Q(10.2): Try one of the other options. GOTO:how

Q(anythingelse): Remember to thoroughly document your repair problem. Take pictures, record video and sounds, track what is happening and when in a notepad, and remember who else has seen the problem so they can be a witness. If you would like to seek legal counsel, you can call our hotline or go online to our website to email an attorney. Is there anything else we can help you with?
