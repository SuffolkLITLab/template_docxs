<p>This is a class project under active development by Suffolk's <a href="http://suffolklitlab.org/" target="_blank">LIT Lab</a>. You should not rely on it as a source of legal information. It is incomplete.</p>
<p>HOME Line is here to help you! HOME Line is a nonprofit Minnesota tenant advocacy organization that you can call at <a href="tel:612-728-5767">612-728-5767</a> or <a href="tel:866-866-3546">866-866-3546</a> for FREE legal help. </p>
<p>You can also answer the following questions to draft a form letter to your landlord asking that they send you a copy of your lease. You could download <a href="http://www.homelinemn.org/wp-content/uploads/copy-of-lease.pdf" target="_blank">a blank form letter</a> and fill it out yourself as well!.</p>
<p>If you do not have a copy of your current lease, use this Letter Bot to help create a letter to send to your landlord to request a copy of your lease.</p>

I am writing to inform you that Minn. Stat. ยง504B.115 requires landlords to provide any tenant who occupies a dwelling unit, whose signature appears on the lease agreement, with a copy of the lease.
