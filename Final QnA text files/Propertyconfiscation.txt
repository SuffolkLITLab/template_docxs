<p>If your landlord has confiscated your property and you would like it returned, use this Letter Bot to help create a letter to send to your landlord.</p>

A: Email Word file to myself.

Note: if you direct this email to an address other than your own, you will have no record that it was sent, and the purpose of the email will not be clear to someone who is not expecting it.

		Q(7.2.1): Wait a moment. You should get a message telling you how things went. GOTO:didthatwork

	DOC(7.3):
<x>lname</x>							
<x>lstreet</x>
<x>laddress</x>

I, <x>tname1</x>, claim that you have intentionally confiscated my property and are holding it at: <x>tstreet</x> <x>taddress</x>

Please be advised that Minnesota Statute § 504B.101 forbids a landlord from holding a tenant’s personal property, even if the tenant is behind on rent. Such conduct may constitute a crime.

As required by Minnesota Statute § 504B.271, you must allow me to take possession of my personal property within: 

<x>twentyfour</x>

If you fail to do so, I may sue for punitive damages of up to the greater of $1,000 or twice actual damages in addition to actual damages (the value of my property), as well as reasonable attorney fees.

Furthermore, Minnesota Statute § 504B.271 forbids the landlord from imposing any fees on the tenant before the tenant picks up his/her property. If you or your agent attempt to charge me any fees up front for return of my property, you will have violated the statute.

I sincerely hope you consider these consequences and you allow me immediate access to my personal property within the required time. I will pick up my property at the address above on:
 <x>weekdaypickup</x>, the <x>day</x> day of <x>month</x>, <x>year</x>.
