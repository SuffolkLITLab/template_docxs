<x>lname</x>

<x>laddress</x>

I, <x>tname1</x>, reside at your property located at <x>tstreet</x>, <x>taddress</x>.


I am writing to inform you that a landlord may not prohibit a tenant from having guests. 

In State v. Hoyt 304 N.W. 2d 884 (Minn. 1981), the Minnesota Supreme Court clearly adopted the rule that a tenant has a right to give guests a license to visit, and the landlord has no right to deny or interfere with this license.  In summary, if I want to have a visitor/guest, that guest has a "claim of right" to visit me, to take a direct route to my door, to socialize with me in my residence, and to socialize with me in the common areas that I myself can visit.  

Please take notice when I have guests such as friends and family, I have granted a license allowing them to do so.  A license includes all steps involved in making these visits, including but not limited to walking to the entrance of the complex, standing in the entryway awaiting entry, walking to my residence, and walking with me, and socializing with me as I or we use the facilities.  

Please consider this my formal assertion of my legal right to have guests. This means that if you take any action against me, I will rely on Minnesota Statute ยง504B.285 and ยง504B.441, which protect me from retaliation.   

Thank you for your prompt consideration of this matter.
